<hr class="full" />
<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p><span class='smcap'>Abdul</span> the D&mdash;d is said to feel it
keenly that, when the British decided
to appoint a Sultan in Egypt, they did
not remember that he was out of a job.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Meanwhile <span class='smcap'>Abbas</span> Pasha is reported
to have had a presentiment that he
would one day be replaced by <span class='smcap'>Kamel</span>
Pasha. <a name='TC_1'></a><ins title="Was 'If'">It</ins> is said that for some time
past he would start nervously whenever
he heard the band of a Highland regiment
playing "The Kamel's a-coming."</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>We have very little doubt that the
German newspapers are publishing
photographs of Whitby
Abbey, and claiming the entire
credit for its ruined condition.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>It remained for <i>The Times</i>
to chronicle the Germans' most
astounding feat. It happened
at Hartlepool. "A chimney
nearly 200 feet in height, on
the North-Eastern Railway
hydraulic power-station, was,"
our contemporary tells us,
"grazed by a projectile about
100 yards above its base."</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>The Archbishop of <span class='smcap'>York</span>,
who was one of the <span class='smcap'>Kaiser's</span>
few apologists, is said to feel
keenly that potentate's ingratitude
in selecting for bombardment
two unprotected bathing-places
in his Grace's diocese.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>It is widely rumoured that
<span class='smcap'>Wilhelm</span> is conferring a
special medal on the perpetrators
of this and similar outrages,
to be called the Kaiser-ye-Hun
medal.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Some of the German newspapers
have been organising a
symposium on the subject of how to
spend the coming Christmas. Herr
<span class='smcap'>Arthur von Gwinner</span>, director of the
Deutsche Bank, is evidently something
of a humourist. "More than ever," he
says, "in the exercise of works of love
and charity." We rather doubt whether
the Herr Direktor's irony will be
appreciated in high quarters.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A message from Amsterdam says
that there are signs in Berlin of
discontent with the German Chancellor
and his staff, and patriots are calling
for a "clean sweep." The difficulty,
of course, is that, while there are
plenty of sweeps in Germany, it is not
easy to find a clean one.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>"Immediately after his arrival at
Rome," says <i>The Liverpool Echo</i>,
"Prince Buelow proceeded to the Villa
Malte, his usual residence at Rome,
where he will stay until he takes up
his quarters at the Caffarelli police."
Our alleged harsh treatment of aliens
fades into insignificance by the side of
this!</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>General Baron <span class='smcap'>von Bissing</span>, the
Governor-General of Belgium, has informed
a German journal that the
<span class='smcap'>Kaiser</span> has "very specially commanded
him to help the weak and oppressed
in Belgium." By whom, we wonder,
are the Belgians being oppressed?</p>
<p>The same journal announces that
General <span class='smcap'>von Diedenhofen</span>, the commander
at Karlsruhe, has issued a
proclamation expressing his "indignation
at the dishonourable conduct"
of three German Red-Cross Nurses who
have married wounded French prisoners.
It certainly does look like taking advantage
of the poor fellows when they were
more or less helpless.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>We hear that considerable ill-feeling
has been caused in certain quarters of
Paris by a thoughtless English newspaper
calling the Germans "the Apaches
of Europe."</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A German critic has been expatiating
on the trouble we must have in feeding
an Army with so many different tastes
and creeds. Commenting on this, <i>The
Evening Standard</i> says: "This is not
a surprising matter from our point of
view, but the German cast-iron system
does not lend itself either in thought
or practice to adaptability." Some
people, we believe, imagine the Germans
feed, without exception, on
Pickelhauben.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A little while ago the Germans were
claiming our <span class='smcap'>Shakspeare</span>. We now
hear that a forthcoming production at
His Majesty's Theatre has set them
longing, in view of the scarcity of the
metal, for our <i>Copperfield</i>.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Thomas Burt</span>, M.P.,
Father of the House of Commons,
has decided to resign his
seat in Parliament. This does
not however mean that the
House will be left an orphan.
Another father will be found
at once.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>It is rumoured that, after
the War is over, a statue is to
be erected to the Censor at
Blankenberghe, in Belgium.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A tale from the Front. "The
enemy are continuing to fortify
the coast, Sir," said the subaltern.
"I don't care if they
fiftify it," roared his commanding
officer; "it'll make
no difference." This shows
the British spirit.</p>

<h2>UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.</h2>
<h3>NO. XII.</h3>
<p class='center'>(<i>From the <span class='smcap'>Ex-Sultan Of Turkey</span>.</i>)</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>My Brother</span>,&mdash;There are many who in these days gnash
their teeth against you and pursue with malice and reproach
the words you utter and the deeds you perform, so that
verily the tempests of the world beat about your head. It
may please you, therefore, to know that there is one man
at least whose affectionate admiration for you has suffered
no decrease, nay, has rather been augmented a hundredfold
by the events of the past half-year. Need I say that I am
that man?</p>
<p>It is true that I have been shorn of my honours and
privileges, that I live in exile as a prisoner and that the vile
insulters of fallen majesty compass me about. I who once
dwelt in splendour and issued my commands to the legions
of the faithful am treated with contumely by a filthy pack
of time-servers, and have nothing that I can call my own
except, for the moment, the air that I breathe. Oh, for an
hour of the old liberty and power! It would amuse me to
see the faces of <span class='smcap'>Enver</span> and of my wretched brother
<span class='smcap'>Mohammed</span> as I ordered them to execution&mdash;them and
their gang of villainous parasites. By the bowstring of
my fathers, but that would be a great and worthy killing!
Pardon the fond day-dreams of a poor and lonely old man
whose only crime has been that he loved his country too
well and treated his enemies with a kindness not to be
understood by those black and revengeful hearts.</p>
<p>I remember that in the old days there were not wanting
those who warned me against you. "Beware," they
said, "of the <span class='smcap'>German Emperor</span>. He will use you for
his own purposes, and will then cast you aside like an
orange that has been squeezed." But I paid no heed to
their jealous imaginings, and I had my reward. Not,
indeed, that you were able to save me when the wicked
burst upon me and cast me down. The stroke was too
sudden, and you, alas, were too far. But the memory of
our delightful friendship is still with me to sustain and
comfort me in my tribulations. I still have some of the
letters in which you poured out your heart to me, and when
melancholy oppresses me I take them from my breast and
read them over and over again.</p>
<p>It is a joy to me to know that there is a firm alliance
between my brave Turks and your magnanimous soldiers.
I doubt not that Allah, the good old friend of the Turks,
will continue to bless you and give you victory after victory
over your enemies. It is no less a joy to learn how gloriously
and how sagaciously you are conducting this war. They
tell me that your ships have bombarded the coast towns of
England, and that five or six hundred of the inhabitants
have fallen before your avenging shells. What matters it
that these towns were not fortified in the strict and stupid
sense, and that there were many women and children
amongst those you slew? The towns <i>were</i> fortified in the
sense that they were hostile to your high benevolence,
and as for women and children you need not even dream
of excusing yourself to <i>me</i>. These English are no better
than Armenians. It is necessary to extirpate them, and
the younger you catch them the less time they have for
devising wickedness against the Chosen of Allah. As for
women, they need hardly be taken into account. In all
these matters I know by your actions that you agree. You
must proceed on your noble course until the last of these
infidels is swept away to perdition.</p>
<p>May I condole with you on the loss of your four ships
of war by the guns of the British Admiral <span class='smcap'>Sturdee</span>? That
was, indeed, a cowardly blow, and it is hard to understand
why it was allowed.</p>
<p>Farewell then, my Brother. Be assured again of the
undying friendship and admiration of the poor exile,</p>
<p class='author'><span class='smcap'>Abdul Hamid.</span></p>

<h2>THE REAL HERO OF THE WAR.</h2>
<p>There is an impression about that
among the candidates for the position
of real hero of the war <span class='smcap'>King Albert</span>
might have a chance; or even Lord
<span class='smcap'>Kitchener</span> or Sir <span class='smcap'>John French</span>. But
I have my doubts, after all that I have
heard&mdash;and I love to hear it and to
watch the different ways in which the
tellers narrate it: some so frankly proud,
some just as proud, but trying to conceal
their pride. After all that I have heard
I am bound to believe that for the real
hero of the war we must look elsewhere.
Not much is printed of this young
fellow's deeds; one gets them chiefly by
word of mouth and very largely in club
smoking-rooms. In railway carriages
too, and at dinner-parties. These are
the places where the champions most
do congregate and hold forth. And
from what they say he is a most gallant
and worthy warrior. Versatile as well,
for not only does he fight and bag his
Bosch, but he is wounded and imprisoned.
Sometimes he rides a motor
cycle, sometimes he flies, sometimes he
has charge of a gun, sometimes he is
doing Red Cross work, and again he
helps to bring up the supplies with the
A.S.C. He has been everywhere. He
was at Mons and he was at Cambrai.
He marched into Ypres and is rather
angry when the Germans are blamed
for shelling the Cloth Hall, because he
tells you that there was a big French
gun firmly established behind it, and
only by shelling the building could the
enemy hope to destroy that dangerous
piece of ordnance. He saw something
of the bombardment of Rheims and he
watched the monitors at work on the
Belgian coast.</p>
<p>And not only does he perform some
of the best deeds and often get rewarded
for them, but he is a good medium for
news too. He hears things. He's
somewhere about when General &mdash;&mdash;
says something of the deepest significance
to General &mdash;&mdash;. He knows
men high up in the War Office. He
refers lightly to <span class='smcap'>Kitchener</span>, and staff
officers apparently tell him many of
their secrets. He speaks quite casually
and familiarly of <span class='smcap'>Winston</span> and what
<span class='smcap'>Winston</span> said yesterday, for he often
has the latest Admiralty news too. It
was he who had the luck to be in
the passage when Lord <span class='smcap'>Fisher</span> and
another Sea Lord executed their historic
waltz on the receipt of the news of
<span class='smcap'>Sturdee's</span> coup. I don't pretend that
he is always as worthy of credence as
he was then; for he has spread some
false rumours too. He was, in fact, one
of the busiest eye-witnesses (once or
twice removed) of the triumphant
progress of millions of Russians through
Scotland and England some months
ago. He is not unaware of the loss of
battleships of which nothing has yet
been officially stated. In fact, his
unofficial news is terrific and sometimes
must be taken with salt. But denials
do not much abash him. He was prepared
for them and can explain them.</p>
<p>His letters are interesting and cover
a vast amount of ground. They are
sometimes very well written, and in
differing moods he abuses the enemy
and pities them. He never grumbles
but is sometimes perplexed by overwork
in the trenches. He hates having to
stand long in water and has lost more
comrades than he likes to think about.
One day he was quite close to General
<span class='smcap'>Joffre</span>, whom he regards as a sagacious
leader, cautious and far-sighted; another
day he was close to Sir <span class='smcap'>John French</span>,
and nothing could exceed the confidence
which his appearance kindled in him.
On the morning of the <span class='smcap'>King's</span> arrival
at the Front he was puzzled by the
evolutions of our air scouts, who seemed
to have gone mad; but it turned out
that they were saluting <span class='smcap'>His Majesty</span>.
Some of his last letters were from the
neighbourhood of Auchy and described
the fighting for the canal. He is a
little inconsistent now and then, and
one day says he has more cigarettes
than he can smoke, and the next bewails
the steady shortage of tobacco.
As to his heroic actions he is reticent;
but we know that many of the finest
deeds have been performed by him.
He has saved lives and guns and is
in sight of the V.C.</p>
<p>And what is his name? Well, I can't
say what his name is, because it is not
always the same; but I can tell you
how he is always described by those
who relate his adventures, his prowess,
his news, his suspicions and his fears.
He is always referred to as "My son."</p>
<p>"My son," when all is said, is the
real hero of the war.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is all very well to warn the British
public (naturalised or otherwise) against
supporting and comforting the enemy,
but it might have more effect if those
in authority set the example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The British Government declares that in
the event of the Austrian Government being
in need of funds, Great Britain is ready to
provide them."&mdash;<i>Japan Chronicle.</i></p>
<p>"King George has sent a warmly-worded
telegram of congratulation to the new Sultan
of Turkey."&mdash;<i>Sunday Chronicle.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paragraphs such as these, for instance,
do not provide the proper inspiration.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"There are increasing rumours of serious
fiction between the Austrians and the Germans."&mdash;<i>Natal
Times.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their <i>forte</i>, however, is humorous
fiction.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p><span class='smcap'>My dear Charles</span>,&mdash;I write on
Christmas Day from a second-grade
Infants' School, the grade referring
obviously to the school and not to the
infants. We sit round the old Yule
hot-water pipe, and from the next classroom
come the heavenly strains of the
gramophone, one of those veteran but
sturdy machines which none of life's
rough usages can completely silence or
even shake in its loyal determination
to go on <i>and keep on going on</i> at all
costs. Having duly impressed "Good
King Wenceslas" upon us, it is now
rendering an emotional waltz, of which,
though now and then it may drop a note
or two, it mislays none of the pathos.</p>
<p>It was a present to the
Mess; intended for our entertainment
in the trenches,
though I cannot think who
was going to carry it there.
The tune serves to recall
the distant past, when we
used to wear silk socks and
shining pumps, to glide
hither and thither on hard
floors, and talk in the intervals,
talk, talk, talk with
all the desperate resource
of exhausted heroes who
know that they have only
to hang on five more minutes
and they are saved. Suppose
we had by now been
in those trenches and had
been listening to this obstinate
old box slowly but
confidently assuring and
reassuring us that there is
and was and always will be our one-two-three
home in the one-two-three,
one-two-three West! I can see the
picture; I can see the tears of happiness
coursing down our weather-beaten
cheeks as we say to ourselves, "Goodness
knows, it's uncomfortable enough
here, but thank heaven we aren't in
that ball-room anyway."</p>
<p>In a corner of this room is a bridge-four.
The C.O. is sitting in an authoritative,
relentless silence. His tactical
dispositions have been made and they
are going to be pushed through to the
end, cost what it may to the enemy or
his own side. His partner is Second-Lieutenant
Combes, deviously thinking
to himself with all the superior knowledge
of youth, "What rotten dispositions
these C.O.'s do make!" but endeavouring
to conceal his feelings by
the manipulation of his face and a
more than usually heavy interspersion
of "Sirs" in his conversation. The
enemy are ill-assorted allies: Captain
Parr, a dashing player of great courage
and very ready tongue, and Lieutenant
Sumners, one of those grim, earnest
fighters whom no event however sudden
or stupendous can surprise into
speech. This latter is a real soldier
whose life is conducted in every particular
on the lines laid down in
military text-books. He asks himself
always, "Is it soldierly?" and never
"Is it common-sense?" He is at
present in trouble with his superior
officer for having frozen on to his ace
of trumps long after he should have
parted with it. But those text-books
say, "Keep your best forces in reserve,"
and so the little trumps must needs be
put in the firing line first.</p>
<p>As to the other officers of your acquaintance,
each is making merry, as
the season demands, in his own fashion.
One is studying, not for the first time,
a map on the wall showing the inner
truth of the currents in the Pacific;
another is observing, for his information
and further guidance, the process of
manufacture of lead pencils as illustrated
by samples in a glass-case.
Others are being more jovial still;
having exhausted the pictures and
advertisements of the sixpenny Society
papers, they are now actually reading
the letter-press. The machine-gun
officer, as I gather from his occasional
remarks, is asleep as usual.</p>
<p>And now the gramophone has ceased;
but, alas! Captain d'Arcy has begun&mdash;on
the piano. As I write, the scheme
of communication between his right
and his left flanks has broken down.
Like a prudent officer, he suspends
operations, gives the "stand-fast!"
and sends out a cautious patrol to
reconnoitre the position. He even
cedes a little of the ground he has
gained. Glancing at his music, I must
admit that he is in a dangerous situation,
heavily wooded in the treble,
with sudden and sharp elevations and
depressions in the bass, and the
possibility of an ambush at every turn.
His reconnoitring party returns; he
starts to move forward again with
scouts always in advance. He halts;
he advances again and proceeds (for he
too is a trained soldier) by short rushes
about five bars at a time.... At last
the situation develops and he pauses to
collect all his available forces and get
them well in hand. I can almost hear
the order being passed along the line&mdash;"Prepare
to charge"&mdash;almost catch the
bugle-call as his ten fingers rush forth
to the assault, forth to death or glory,
to triumph or utter confusion.... As
to what follows, I have always thought
the rally after a charge was an anticlimax,
even when it consists
of a rapid "Rule Britannia!"
passing off evenly,
without a hitch.</p>
<p>I find, looking round my
fellow-officers, that I have
omitted the final touch, the
last stirring detail to complete
the picture of the
soldier's hard but eventful
life. In the one easy, or
easy-ish, chair sits the
Major, that gallant gentleman
whose sole but exacting
business in life it is to
gallop like the devil into
the far distance when it is
rumoured that the battalion
will deploy. He sits now at
leisure, but even at leisure
he is not at ease: silent,
with every nerve and fibre
strained to the utmost tension,
he crouches over his work. He
is at his darning; ay, with real wool
and a real needle he is darning his
socks. The colour of his work may
not be harmonious, but it is a
thorough job; he has done what even
few women would do, he has darned
not only the hole in his hosiery but his
left hand also.</p>
<p>As for the men, they have been dealt
with by a select body under the formidable
title of the Christmas Festivities
Committee. It has provided each man
with a little beer, a lot of turkey and
much too much plum pudding. Having
disengaged the birds into their separate
units, it has then left the man to himself
for the day, thus showing, in my
opinion, a wise discretion rarely found
in committees, even military committees.</p>

<h2>THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL.</h2>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>I rode into Pincher River on an August afternoon,</p>
<p>The pinto's hoofs on the prairie drumming a drowsy tune,</p>
<p>By the shacks and the Chinks' truck-gardens to the Athabasca saloon.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>And a bunch of the boys was standing around by the old Scotch store,</p>
<p>Standing and spitting and swearing by old Macallister's door&mdash;</p>
<p>And the name on their lips was Britain&mdash;the word that they spoke was War.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>War!... Do you think I waited to talk about wrong or right</p>
<p>When I knew my own old country was up to the neck in a fight?</p>
<p>I said, "So long!"&mdash;and I beat it&mdash;"I'm hitting the trail to-night."</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I wasn't long at my packing. I hadn't much time to dress,</p>
<p>And the cash I had at disposal was a ten-spot&mdash;more or less;</p>
<p>So I didn't wait for my ticket; I booked by the Hoboes' Express.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I rode the bumpers at night-time; I beat the ties in the day;</p>
<p>Stealing a ride and bumming a ride all of the blooming way,</p>
<p>And&mdash;I left the First Contingent drilling at Valcartier!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>I didn't cross in a liner (I hadn't my passage by me!);</p>
<p>I spotted a Liverpool cargo tramp, smelly and greasy and grimy,</p>
<p>And they wanted hands for the voyage, and the old man guessed he'd try me.</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then came an autumn morning, grey-blue, windy and clear,</p>

<h2>THE PEACE-MAKER.</h2>
<p>The Anonymous War is not to be
followed by an Anonymous Peace. I
have Twyerley's own authority for this
statement.</p>
<p>I may go farther and make public the
interesting fact that Twyerley himself
has the matter in hand, and readers of
<i>The Daily Booster</i> will at an early date
receive precise instructions how and
where to secure Part I. of The History
of the Peace before it is out of print.
It is well known that all publications
issuing from that Napoleonic brain are
out of print within an hour or two of
their appearance, but Twyerley takes
precautions to safeguard readers of <i>The
Booster</i> against any such catastrophic
disappointment.</p>
<p>In approaching the Peace problem
at this stage Twyerley is displaying his
customary foresight. The military
authorities frustrated Twyerley's public-spirited
attempt to let the readers
of <i>The Booster</i> into the secret of General
<span class='smcap'>Joffre's</span> strategy&mdash;ruthlessly
suppressing his daily column on The
Position at the Front. He has resolved
that the diplomatists shall not repeat
the offence; he will be beforehand with
them.</p>
<p>If Twyerley had been listened to in
times of peace there would have been
no war; the fact is undeniable. Since
war has come, however, the danger of a
patched-up peace must be avoided at all
costs. In order that there shall be no
mistake Twyerley has prepared a map
of Europe-as-it-must-be-and-shall-be
or Twyerley and his myriad readers will
know the reason why. (The map is
presented gratis with Part I. of the
History and may also be had, varnished
and mounted on rollers, for clubs and
military academies.)</p>
<p>Twyerley at work upon the map is a
thrilling spectacle. With his remorseless
scissors he hovers over Germany
and Austria in a way that would make
the two <span class='smcap'>Kaisers</span> blench. Snip! away
goes Alsace-Lorraine and a slice of the
Palatinate; another snip! and Galicia
flutters into the arms of Russia.</p>
<p>The History is to be completed in
twenty-four parts, if the Allies' plenipotentiaries
possess the capabilities
with which Twyerley credits them; but
he has prudently provided for extensions
in case of need.</p>
<p>Anyway, whether the Treaty of Peace
be signed in twelve months or twelve
years, the final part of the History will
go to press on the morrow.</p>
<p>Armed with the History, readers of
<i>The Booster</i> will be able to follow step
by step the contest in the council-chamber,
when it takes place. They
will be able to paint the large white
map with the special box of colours
supplied at a small additional cost.
That, as Twyerley justly observes, is an
ideal means of teaching the new geography
of Europe to children. Even
the youngest member of a household
where the History is taken regularly
will be in a position to say what loss
of territory the <span class='smcap'>Kaisers</span> and Turkey
must suffer. (Twyerley had some idea
of running a Prize Competition on
these lines but was reluctant to embarrass
the Government.)</p>
<p>Several entire chapters will be devoted
to "Famous Scraps of Paper"
from <span class='smcap'>Nebuchadnezzar</span> to the Treaty
of Bucharest. Illustrations of unique
interest have been secured. For instance,
the Peace of Westphalia carries
a reproduction of the original document,
portraits and biographies of the signatories,
and a statistical table of the
Westphalian ham industry. Similarly,
the Treaty of Utrecht is accompanied
by a view of that interesting town and
several pages of original designs for
Utrecht velvet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page536' name='page536'></a>[pg 536]</span></div>
<p>Thus, what Twyerley calls "the
human interest" is amply catered for.</p>
<p>The section "International Law for
the Million" presents its subject in a
novel tabloid form, as exhaustive as it
is entertaining. I know for a fact that
an army of clerks has been engaged at
the British Museum for some weeks
looking up the data.</p>
<p>Following the part which contains
concise accounts of every European
nation from the earliest times, comes
"Points for Plenipotentiaries," occupying
several entire numbers. Here is
where the genius of Twyerley shines at
its brightest, and personally I think
that the British representatives at the
Peace Congress should be provided
beforehand with these invaluable pages.
With Twyerley at their elbows, so to
speak, they should be equal to the task
of checkmating the wily foreigner.</p>
<p>I wish the <span class='smcap'>Kaiser</span> could see Twyerley
scissoring his territory to shreds!</p>
<hr />
<h2>A VOICE IN THE NIGHT.</h2>
<p>I dislike many things&mdash;snakes, for
example, and German spies, and the
income tax, and cold fat mutton; but
even more than any of these I dislike
William Smith.</p>
<p>As all the world knows, special
constables hunt in couples at nights,
a precaution adopted in order that, if
either of the two is slain in the execution
of his duty, the other may be in a
position to report on the following
morning the exact hour and manner
of his decease, thus satisfying the
thirst of the authorities for the latest
information, and relieving his departed
companion's relatives of further anxiety
in regard to his fate.</p>
<p>William Smith is the special constable
who hunts with me. As to
whom or what we are hunting, or
what we should do to them or they
would do to us if we caught them or
they caught us, we are rather vague;
but we endeavour to carry out our duty.
Our total bag to date has been one
Royal Mail, and even him we merely
let off with a caution.</p>
<p>Three days ago, by an unfortunate
coincidence, William Smith overtook
me at the end of the High Street, just
as our sergeant was coming round the
corner in the opposite direction. At
sight of the latter we halted, dropped
our parcels in the mud, stiffened to
attention and saluted. The last was
a thing we ought not to have done,
even allowing for his leggings, which
were (and are still) of a distinctly
upper-military type. But in the special
constabulary your sergeant is a man to
be placated. His powers are enormous.
He can, if he likes, spoil your
beauty sleep at both ends by detailing
you for duty from 12 to 4 <span class='smcaplc'>A.M</span>.; or, on
the other hand, he can forget you
altogether for a fortnight. Thus we
always avoid meeting him if possible;
failing that, we always salute him.</p>
<p>"Ha!" exclaimed our sergeant.</p>
<p>We shuddered, and William Smith,
who is smaller than myself, tried to
escape his gaze by forming two deep.</p>
<p>"What the devil are you playing
at?" growled our sergeant. Though
one of the more prominent sidesmen at
our local church, he has developed
quite the manner of an officer, almost,
at times, I like to think, of a general
officer. William Smith formed single
rank again.</p>
<p>Our sergeant took out his notebook.
"I'm glad I happened to meet you
two," he said.</p>
<p>We shivered, but otherwise remained
at attention.</p>
<p>"Let me see," he went on, consulting
his list, "you are on together again to-morrow
night at 12."</p>
<p>It was the last straw. Forgetting
his rank, forgetting his leggings, forgetting
the possibilities of his language,
forgetting myself, I spoke.</p>
<p>"I protest," I said.</p>
<p>The eyes of our sergeant bulged
with wrath, pushing his pince-nez off
his nose and causing them to clatter
to the pavement. But a special constable
is a man of more than ordinary
courage. "Allow me," I murmured,
and I stooped, picked them up and
handed them back to him.</p>
<p>"Explain yourself," he muttered
hoarsely.</p>
<p>"For the past three months," I said,
"I have endured fifty-six of the darkest
hours of the night, cut off from any
possibility of human aid, in the company
of William Smith, a conversational
egoist of the lowest and most determined
type. Throughout this period he has
inflicted on me atrocities before which
those of the Germans pale into insignificance.
During the first month he
described to me in detail the achievements
and diseases from birth upwards
of all his children&mdash;a revolting record.
He next proceeded to deal exhaustively
with the construction and working of
his gramophone, his bathroom geyser,
his patent knife-machine and his
vacuum carpet-cleaner; also with his
methods of drying wet boots, marking
his under-linen, circumventing the
water-rate collector and inducing fertility
in reluctant pullets. This brought
us to the middle of November. Finally,
during the last four weeks he has
wandered into the ramifications of his
wife's early-Victorian family tree, of
which we are still in the lower branches.</p>
<p>"I cannot retaliate in kind. I have
no children, poultry, pedigree wives, nor
any of the other articles, except boots
and shirts, in which the soul of William
Smith rejoices. There is but one
remedy open to me, and of this, unless
you detail me for duty with someone
else, I propose to avail myself at the
first convenient opportunity. I shall
kill William Smith."</p>
<p>I stopped and saluted again.</p>
<p>And then a wonderful thing happened.
I discovered that beneath our sergeant's
military leggings there still beat the
rudiments of a human heart. Yes, as I
looked at him I saw his softened eyes
suffused with sympathetic tears.</p>
<p>"My poor fellow!" he said in a
broken voice.</p>
<p>It was too much. I sank to the
pavement, saluting as I fell, and knew
no more. When I recovered consciousness
in hospital I found in the pocket
of my coat an envelope containing the
following: "Promoted to the rank of
corporal and invalided for three weeks,
after which you will take duty with
your chauffeur."</p>
<p>William Smith and I have severed
diplomatic relations. It is better so.</p>
<hr />
<h3>REJECTED OFFERINGS.</h3>
<p><span class='smcap'>My dear</span> <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;In these first
few days after Christmas many of your
readers are no doubt faced, as we have
been, with a problem which is quite
new to them. I hope they took the
precaution&mdash;as we did&mdash;to write and
explain to all likely givers (1) that this
was no year for the exchange of Christmas
gifts among grown-up people who
have no need for them; (2) that it was
the opinion of all right-thinking persons
that no such gifts should be sent,
and (3) that consequently they were
sending none and hoped to receive
none.</p>
<p>That is all right as far as it goes, but
the problem remains of what is to be
done with those people who can't be
stopped? We have had several painful

<h2>THE NEXT?</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>Bombardment of Little Shrimpington by the German Fleet</span>.</h3>
<p class='center'>(<i>Extract from a Report by the German
Admiral.</i>)</p>
<p class='center'><i>Battle-cruiser</i> "<i>Von Herod</i>."</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Sir</span>,&mdash;With regard to the recent
magnificent and hoch-compelling exploit
of the Imperial Squadron I have
the honour to report as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Our battle-cruisers sighted the
strongly-fortified sea-coast town of
Little Shrimpington about 12.45, and
at once opened a devastating fire. A
hostile abbey, situated in a commanding
position at the cliff top, and quite
unmistakable (as at Whitby), was the
first to fall. The shelling of this
edifice, to which I learn that the
Christians attach considerable importance,
for some reason that I am unable
to comprehend, cannot fail to produce
lively satisfaction among our brave
allies at Constantinople.</p>
<p>Next turning our guns upon the golf
links, in fifteen rounds we put out of
action a nine-hole course for ladies.
Much confusion was observed here
amongst the enemy; the presence of
troops being proved by the movement
of several bodies in bright scarlet. It
is conjectured from this that the supply
of khaki is already exhausted.</p>
<p>Magnificent execution was done upon
the extensive sand castles with which
the foreshore was covered, and for
which indeed it is renowned throughout
the island. Our heavy armament was
in every case enabled to demolish these,
at the same time slaughtering the
children and nurses responsible for
them. It is to be admitted however
that at a more favourable season of the
year the execution here, good as it was,
would have been considerably better.</p>
<p>Altogether some five hundred shells
were fired, as recently at Scarborough,
and there can be no doubt that the
enemy's casualties, in women especially,
must be very considerable. In addition,
he is known to have lost heavily in
bathing-machines, and several super-rowing
boats were seen to sink at
their moorings.</p>
<p>Throughout the action the entire
absence of any return fire had a most
heartening effect upon the personnel of
the Imperial fleet, who were thus
enabled to work under what may be
called conditions ideal to the German
fighting spirit. I cannot refrain from
expressing my sense of how greatly the
magnificent result of the action was due
to the patriotic foresight of my chief
officer, Fire-direktor Von Ketch, who,
having met with a motor accident when
touring in England so lately as last
spring at the gates of Shrimpington
Hall, had the good fortune to be the
guest for several weeks of the Frau
Squire and her daughters. Not only was
the information thus obtained of the
greatest assistance in the general
conduct of the operations, but we were
enabled to place our first six-inch shell
exactly on the dining-room of the Hall
at an hour when the occupants were
almost certainly assembled for lunch.</p>
<p>The entire action occupied twenty-five
minutes, and concluded with the
approach of the British patrol, when,
acting in accordance with the dictates
of Imperial policy, we ran like hares.
So satisfactory has been this glorious
and civilian-sanguinary encounter that
our brave fellows are now eager to try
conclusions with the bath-chairs of
Bournemouth or the lobster-pots of
Llandudno. It is indeed with true
sentiments of fraternal pride that the
Imperial Navy is now able to place
the torn fragments of the Hague Convention
beside those of the Treaties so
gloriously deleted by our brothers of
the Imperial Army.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be, Sir, etc., etc.</p>

<h2>VICTORINE.</h2>
<p>Victorine, our new general, is a
Belgian refugee. She was naturally
somewhat broken in spirit on first
entering our establishment, but as the
days went by she became happier, and
so enterprising and ingratiating that
we hastened to smother in its infancy
a shameful doubt as to whether or not
we had introduced into our sympathetic
bosoms a potential viper. Morning,
noon and night there was continuous
scrubbing, polishing and beeswaxing;
at all moments one was meeting a pink
and breathless Victorine, and the house
echoed to an interminable stream of
information in the French tongue.</p>
<p>At mealtime, the verdict having
been duly pronounced on each successive
dish, Victorine would stand by
while we ate, and unburden herself
confidentially. 'Mon mari' (Jean
Baptiste, a co-refugee who had searched
all London for a place as <i>valet de
chambre</i>) was lightly touched upon.
Belgium was described in glowing
terms, a land of wonders we had not
dreamt of.</p>
<p>"Miss will not believe me, but when
first we arrive in England all the
world cries, 'Oh! regard then the little
sheep!' For Mademoiselle must know
that in Belgium the sheep are high and
big as that" (Victorine sketches in the
air the dimensions of a good-sized
donkey). "Monsieur mocks himself
of me? Monsieur should visit my <i>pays</i>
where dwell the sheep of a bigness and
a fatness to rejoice the heart, and
whose wool is of a softness incredible;
Monsieur would not then smile thus in
his beard." Victorine assumes an attitude
of virtuous indignation, disturbed
by the ringing of the telephone bell.</p>
<p>"I save myself," she murmurs.</p>
<p>Through the half-open door we hear
as usual only scraps of dialogue, all on
one side, and very unsatisfying.</p>
<p>"Alloa! J'&eacute;coute! Madame, je ne
parle que le fran&ccedil;ais&mdash;hein?" Long
pause. "Alloa! Alloa!" Victorine
rattles the instrument impatiently.
"Ah! &ccedil;a y est! Si Madame d&eacute;sire que
j'appelle Miss&mdash;&mdash;? Quel nom? Hein?
Meesus Tsch&mdash;arch&mdash;kott. Mon
Dieu&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Victorine lays down the receiver and
comes back flushed into the room.</p>
<p>"C'est Meesus Arch-tsch-kott qui
demande Miss au t&eacute;l&eacute;phone. She
desire to know if Miss will take the
dinner with her. Are they difficult
these English names!"</p>
<p>But English names are not Victorine's
sole difficulty. She wrestles (mentally)
from time to time with the butcher and
the baker and the milkman. The milkman,
it seems, is "un peu fou." Victorine
greets him in the mornings in voluble
French, and he in return bows elaborately
and pretends to drop the milk.
We have watched the process from an
upper window. Victorine takes a step
backward, her hand flies to her heart,
and, as she afterwards informs us, "her
blood gives but a turn" at this exhibition
of British wit. We have been wondering
whether it would be judicious to
teach her to say, "Get along with yer."</p>
<p>She is very prolific in "ideas," and
seems to be chiefly inspired when engaged
in the uncongenial pastime of
cleaning the grate.</p>
<p>"Know you, Miss, that I have an
idea, me?"</p>
<p>"No, really, Victorine."</p>
<p>"Yes," says Victorine, mournfully
shaking her head, "but only an idea."
Victorine lays down her implements
and places her hands on her hips.
"If," she says slowly, "this Meesus
Schmeet who was with Mr. and Miss
before my arrival was a German spy,
hein?"</p>
<p>"But why, Victorine?"</p>
<p>Victorine assumes an air of owl-like
wisdom.</p>
<p>"See here," she says, placing the
forefinger of one hand on the thumb of
the other, "first she depart to care for
the niece who is suffering&mdash;it is
generally the mother, but that imports
not. Then," counting along her fingers,
"during three months she is absent,
and, thirdly," sinking her voice, "she
sends for her <i>malles</i>, which contain
doubtless&mdash;who knows?&mdash;plans of
London, designs of the fortresses, and
perhaps a telegraphy without wires&mdash;Marconi,
what do I know? Mademoiselle
must admit that it has the air
droll?"</p>
<p>We do our best to allay Victorine's
anxiety. She however is not at all
convinced, and evidently reserves to
herself full liberty of action to protect
us from German espionage and the
effects of our own guilelessness at a
later date.</p>
<p>In the rare moments when not at
work she is pensive, but her imagination
is by no means at rest. She gazes
languidly out of the window into "<i>ce
brouillard</i>," as she fondly calls a slight
morning mist. The sparrows interest
her.</p>
<p>"See, Miss, a sparrow who carries a
piece of bread big as a house; is it then
an English sparrow that accomplishes
such prodigies?"</p>
<p>Not quite fathoming the drift of
Victorine's meditations we suggest that
it is perhaps a Belgian refugee sparrow,
at which her amusement is so intense
that she is obliged to leave the room.</p>
<p>Sometimes her fancy takes great
flights, for she is very <a name='TC_2'></a><ins title="Added period">high-minded.</ins>
Her weekly bath gives rise to much
lofty philosophical reflection, and she
has come to the firm conclusion that it
is "mieux que manger." Also she has
great taste, of which she occasionally
gives us the benefit. She laughs scornfully
at certain <i>objets d'art</i> and praises
others. Ornaments, if they meet with
her approval, are arranged in rigid lines
of continuous beauty, less favoured ones
being pushed into the background, and
books are disposed with assumed carelessness
in thoughtful postures. Though
it is plain she thinks little of our taste
in general, her disapproval is usually
silent. It is therefore with almost
choking pride that we receive her praise,
though it is often, we fear, of a disingenuous
nature.</p>
<p>"It is plain that Miss has the eye
artistic: that sees itself well in the new
basin she has bought to replace the one
that fell by hazard and burst itself.
Monsieur also has the eye straight. In
effect the picture there that Monsieur
designs is of a justness, but of a justness!
One would say the place itself,"
leaning back and half closing her eyes.
"In Belgium could it not be better
done. No. It is I, Victorine, who say
it. If Monsieur has the false digestion,
by contrary it is evident that he has
the head solid."</p>
<p>But Victorine has a fault dark and
grievous in the British eye. She jibs
at fresh air.</p>
<p>"Surely Mr., and above all Miss,
will take a congestion with the window
grand-open of that fashion? As for
me I have the neuralgias to make fear!
Figure to yourself that in the kitchen
the three windows (where one would
well suffice, go) if open make to pass
a hurricane!"</p>
<p>A short lecture follows, in which the
ill effects of stuffiness are pointed out,
and Victorine is reduced to unconvinced
and mutinous silence. As the days
pass a little acquiescence in "cette
manie pour les courants d'air" is visible,
but at the slightest approach of cold
every aperture through which air may
possibly find its way is surreptitiously
closed, and it is only when she is out
with her husband taking a walk or
refreshing the inner man in a "caf&eacute;"
with "un peu de stoot" that we can
penetrate by stealth into her bedroom
and air it.</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste is for the moment in
disgrace because he has not been to see
Victorine for a week. He is threatened
with all sorts of penalties when he
finally decides to present himself.
Primarily Victorine is going to present
him with <i>savon</i>, which appears in the
vernacular to be the Belgian equivalent
for beans. She is also going to wash
him the head.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class='center'>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Sir John Lubbock</i>, whose Life, by Mr. <span class='smcap'>Horace Hutchinson,
Macmillan</span> publishes in two volumes, was one of
the most honourable men who figured in public life during
the last half-century. He was also one of the most widely
honoured. Under his name on the title-page of the book
appears a prodigious paragraph in small type enumerating
the high distinctions bestowed upon him by British and
foreign literary and scientific bodies. Forestalling the leisure
of a bank-holiday I have counted the list and find it contains
no fewer than fifty-two high distinctions, one for every week
of the year. These were won not by striking genius or brilliant
talent. Sir <span class='smcap'>John Lubbock</span>, to preserve a name which
the crowning honour of the peerage did not displace in the
public mind, was by nature and daily habit constitutionally
industrious. After Eton he joined his father's banking
business. In his diary under date Christmas Day, 1852,
being the nineteenth year of his age, he gives an account
of how he spends his day. It is too long to quote, but,
beginning by "getting up at half-past six," it includes
steady reading in natural history, poetry, political economy,
science, mathematics and German. Breakfast, luncheon
and tea are mentioned in due course; but there is no reference
to dinner or supper. These functions were doubtless regarded
by the young student as frivolous waste of time.</p>
<p>I knew <span class='smcap'>Lubbock</span> personally during his long membership
of the House of Commons. He had neither grace of diction
nor charm of oratory. But he had a way of getting Bills
through all their stages which exceeded the average attained
by more attractive speakers. In his references to Parliamentary
life he mentions that <span class='smcap'>Gladstone</span>, when he proposed
to abolish the Income Tax, told him that he intended
to meet the deficiency partly by increase of the death duties.
That was a fundamental principle of the Budget Lord
<span class='smcap'>Randolph Churchill</span> prepared during his brief Chancellorship
of the Exchequer. It was left to Sir <span class='smcap'>William Harcourt</span>
to realise the fascinating scheme, later to be extended
by Mr. <span class='smcap'>Lloyd George</span>. Another of Lord <span class='smcap'>Randolph's</span>
personally unfulfilled schemes was the introduction of one-pound
notes. In a letter dated 16th December, 1886, he
confidentially communicated his project to <span class='smcap'>Lubbock</span>.
When his book reaches its second edition Mr. <span class='smcap'>Hutchinson</span>
will have an opportunity of correcting a misapprehension
set forth on page 48. He writes that, on June 21st, 1895,
"all were startled by an announcement that Mr. <span class='smcap'>Gladstone</span>
had resigned and that Parliament was to be dissolved."
The surprise was not unnatural since Lord <span class='smcap'>Rosebery</span> was
Prime Minister at this memorable crisis.</p>
<hr />
<p>I can see some good in most people, but none whatever
in those chairmen of meetings who, being put up to introduce
distinguished speakers, thoroughly well worth listening
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page544' name='page544'></a>[pg 544]</span>
to, feel called upon to delay matters by making lengthy
speeches themselves. I propose to be quite brief in
announcing <span class='smcap'>Professor Stephen Leacock</span> on <i>Arcadian
Adventures with the Idle Rich</i> (<span class='smcap'>Lane</span>). Conceive this arch-humourist
let loose, if so rough a term may be applied to
so delicate a wit, among the sordid and fleshly plutocracy
of a progressive American city; imagine his polished satire
expending itself on such playful themes as the running of
fashionable churches on strictly commercial lines, dogma
and ritualism being so directed and adapted as to leave the
largest possible dividends on the Special Offertory Cumulative
Stock, and your appetite will be whetted for an
intellectual feast of the most delicious flavour. For myself,
I found a certain quiet but intense delight in the first five
stories, episodes in the lives of individual billionaires; but
when I came to the last three, which dealt with the class
as a collective whole, then I became frankly and noisily
hilarious. I am not given to
being tiresome in the reading-room;
it is another of the unforgivable
offences; but I defy
any man of intelligence to read
those chapters and retain even
a fair remnant of self-control.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>The Lighter Side of School
Life</i> (<span class='smcap'>Foulis</span>) is one of the
merriest and shrewdest books
that I have met for a long time.
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Ian Hay</span> pleasantly dedicates
his work "to the members
of the most responsible, the least
advertised, the worst paid, and
the most richly rewarded profession
in the world"; and you
will not have turned two pages
before discovering that the writer
of them knows pretty thoroughly
what he is writing about. For
my own part I claim to have
some experience both of schoolmasters
and boys, and I can say
at once that the former at least
have seldom been dealt with
more faithfully than by Mr. <span class='smcap'>Hay</span>.
His chapter on "Some Form
Masters" is a thing of the purest joy; bitingly true, yet
withal of a kindly sympathy with his victims. One would
say that he knows boys as well, were it not for the
conviction that to imagine any kind of understanding of
Boydom is (if my contemporaries will forgive me) the last
enchantment of the middle-aged, and the most fallacious.
As for the Educational experts, he has all the cold and
calculated hate for them that is the mark of experience.
I admired especially his treatment of the "craze for practical
teaching," the theory which holds, for example, that,
instead of postulating a fixed relation between the circumference
of a circle and its diameter, a teacher should supply
his boys with several ordinary tin canisters, a piece of
string and a ruler, and leave the form to work out their
own result. Decidedly, Mr. <span class='smcap'>Hay</span> has seen <i>The Lighter
Side of School Life</i> with the eye of knowledge; and when
I mention that your own eyes will here encounter a dozen
pictures by Mr. <span class='smcap'>Lewis Baumer</span> at his delightful best&mdash;well,
I suppose, enough said.</p>

</div>
<hr />
<p>At one time, I hope for ever gone, Mr. <span class='smcap'>Percy White's</span>
sense of irony ran away with him. He seemed to have
said to himself, "I can write witty dialogue and I have a
shrewd eye for foibles, and if you are not satisfied with
that you can take it or leave it." I for one took it,
but always with a feeling that he was offering me a sparkling
wine of a quality not first-rate, whereas with a little
more trouble and expense he could have offered me an
unimpeachable brand. Now that <i>Cairo</i> (<span class='smcap'>Constable</span>) has provided
me with what I have been waiting for, I am more than
delighted to present my acknowledgments. Mr. <span class='smcap'>White's</span>
subject is pat to the moment; moreover it is handled with
such unobtrusive skill that one absorbs a serious problem
without being anxiously conscious that all the play of
intrigue and adventure is covering a much deeper motive.
When Mr. <span class='smcap'>White</span> sent <i>Daniel Addington</i> to Egypt to meet
<i>Abdul Sayed</i>, who had been at Oxford and was a leader of
the Young Egyptian party, he gave himself a chance of
which he has taken full advantage. It is true that
<i>Addington</i> cried a pest on all politics as soon as he fell a
victim to the charms of <i>Ann
Donne</i>, a widow of excessive
sprightliness; but by that time
he was too deeply enmeshed in
the nets of intrigue to escape
the just reward of those amateurs
who dabble with critical
situations. <i>Abdul</i> regarded him
as a "milksop," and so he was
from <i>Abdul's</i> full-blooded point
of view; but I can also see in
him a fresh testimony to the
courage of our race. For he
married the widow <i>Ann</i>, and
that was a very plucky thing to
do.</p>
<hr />
<p>The only thing that I didn't
like about <i>Molly, My Heart's
Delight</i> (<span class='smcap'>Smith, Elder</span>) was the
title. But to allow yourself to
be put off by this will be to
miss one of the pleasantest
books of the season. What I
might call true fiction has always
held a peculiar charm for me.
In the present work that clever
writer, <span class='smcap'>Katharine Tynan</span>, has
been lucky and astute enough
to find an ideal heroine, ready made to her hand, in the
person of the charming woman who married <span class='smcap'>Dean Delany</span>.
Upon the basis of her diaries and letters the romance has
been built up, with the excellent result of a blend of art
and actuality that is most engaging. <i>Molly</i> is the gayest
of creatures in her girlhood. We see her character develop
gradually, tamed and half broken by her unhappy first
marriage (an episode exquisitely treated, so that even the
ugly side of it bears yet some precious jewels of charity
and long-suffering), tried in the fire of romantic adoration,
and finally reaching its appointed destiny in the comradeship
with "kind, tender, faithful D.D." Lovers of diaries
and memoirs, equally with those who like a graceful tale
well told, will find what they want here, from the moment
when its heroine goes, a girl-bride, to the romantically
gloomy house of Rhoscrow, to that other moment when
the placid mistress of the Deanery hears of the death of
<i>Bellamy</i>, the man whom all her life she really loved. This
book of <i>Molly</i> should be a "heart's delight" to many.</p>

<h2>PUNCH IN THE TRENCHES.</h2>
<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> drew another letter from the heap on his office-desk and opened it.</p>
<p class='ralign'><i>Polwheedle, Cornwall.</i></p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear</span> <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;An amusing incident happened here yesterday. I was talking to an old countryman, a
great character in the village, and I happened to make some remark about the War. "What war?" asked old Jarge.
"The European War," I answered in surprise. "Well," he said, "they've got a fine day for it." I thought this would
interest you.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Yours etc.,</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>John Brown</span>.</p>
</div></div>
<p>"Two hundred and eighteen," said <i>Mr. Punch</i> to himself, and took the next letter from the heap.</p>
<p class='ralign'><i>Wortleberry, Sussex.</i></p>
<p>Mr. William Smith presents his compliments to <i>Mr. Punch</i> and begs to send him the following dialogue which
occurred in this village yesterday:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Myself.</i> "Well, what do you think of the War, Jarge?"</p>
<p><i>Jarge.</i> "What war?"</p>
<p><i>Myself (surprised).</i> "The European War."</p>
<p><i>Jarge.</i> "They've got a fine day for it, anyhow."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith thought you would like this.</p>
<p>"Two hundred and nineteen," said <i>Mr. Punch</i> to himself, "not counting the South African or Crimean ones."
He sighed and selected a third letter.</p>
<p class='ralign'><i>Sporransprock, Kirkcudbrightshire.</i></p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear</span> <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;How's this? I asked a native what he thought of the War. On being told which war, he
replied, "Eh, mon, ye ken, but they've got a gran'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>At this point <i>Mr. Punch</i> rose from his chair and began to pace the room restlessly.</p>
<p>"There must be more in life than this," he said to himself again and again; "this can't be all."</p>
<p>He looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"Yes," he murmured, "that's it. I shall just have time."</p>
<p>Hastily donning the military overcoat of an Honorary Cornet-Major of the Bouverie Street Roughriders, he left
for the Front.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mud, and then again mud, and then very much more mud.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page546' name='page546'></a>[pg 546]</span></div>
<p>"Halt! Who goes there?" "Friend," said <i>Mr. Punch</i> hopefully. "It's <i>Mr. Punch</i>," said a cheerful voice.
"Come in."</p>
<p>The Cornet-Major of the B.S.R. glissaded into the trench and found himself shaking hands with a very young
subaltern of the &mdash;&mdash;th &mdash;&mdash;s. [<i>Censored.</i>]</p>
<p>"Thought I recognised you," he said. "Glad to see you out here, Sir."</p>
<p>"That's really what I came about," said <i>Mr. Punch</i>. "I want your advice."</p>
<p>"My advice! Good Lord!... Sure you're comfortable there? Now what'll you have? Cigar or barley-sugar?"
<i>Mr. Punch</i> accepted a cigar.</p>
<p>"We're all for barley-sugar ourselves just now," the subaltern went on. "Seems kiddish, but there it is."</p>
<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> lit his cigar and proceeded to explain himself.</p>
<p>"I say that I have come to consult you," he began. "It seems strange, you think. I am seventy-three, and
you are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Twenty-two," said the subaltern. "Next November."</p>
<p>"And yet Seventy-three comes here to sit at the feet of Twenty-two, and for every encouraging word that
Twenty-two offers him Seventy-three will say 'Thank you!'"</p>
<p>"Rats," said Twenty-two for a start.</p>
<p>"Let me explain," said the Venerable One. "There come moments in the life of every man when he says
suddenly to himself, 'What am I doing? Is it worth it?'&mdash;a moment when the work of which he has for years
been proud seems all at once to be of no value whatever." The subaltern murmured something. "No, not necessarily
indigestion. There may be other causes. Well, such a moment has just come to me ... and I wondered." He
hesitated, and then added wistfully, "Perhaps you could say something to help me."</p>
<p>"The pen," said the subaltern, coughing slightly, "is mightier than the sword."</p>
<p>"It is," said the Sage. "I've often said so ... in Peace time."</p>
<p>The subaltern blushed as he searched his mind for the Historic Example.</p>
<p>"Didn't <span class='smcap'>Wolfe</span> say that he would rather have written what's-its-name than taken Quebec?" he asked
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Yes, he did. And for most of his life the poet would have agreed with him. But, if at the moment when
he read of the taking of Quebec you had asked <span class='smcap'>Gray</span>, I think he would have changed places with <span class='smcap'>Wolfe</span> very
willingly.... And in Bouverie Street," added <i>Mr. Punch</i>, "we read of the takings of Quebecs almost every day."</p>
<p>The subaltern was thoughtful for a moment.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you a true story," he said quietly. "There was a man in this trench who had his leg shot off. They
couldn't get him away till night, and here he had to wait for the whole of the day.... He stuck it out....
And what do you think he stuck it out on?"</p>
<p>"Morphia?" suggested <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>
<p>"Partly on morphia, and partly on&mdash;something else."</p>
<p>"Yes?" said <i>Mr. Punch</i> breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;<i>you</i>. He read ... and he laughed ... and by-and-by the night came."</p>
<p>A silence came over them both. Then <i>Mr. Punch</i> got up quietly.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he said, holding out his hand, "and thank you. That moment I spoke about seems to have gone."
He took a book from under his arm and placed it in the other's hands. "I generally give this away with rather a flourish,"
he confessed. "This time I'll just say, 'Will you take it?' It's all there; all that I think and hope and dream, and
that you out here are doing.... Good luck to you&mdash;and let me help some more of you to stick it out."</p>
<p>And with that he returned to Bouverie Street, leaving behind in the trench his</p>

<p><b>Transcriber Notes</b></p>
<p>Page 538 was moved to just after page 535, as the Peace-Maker article clearly begins on page 538 and concludes on page 536.
The original page numbers have been retained, however, and are therefore out of order.</p>
<p>Other typographical inconsistencies that have been changed are
listed below.</p>
<p>Archaic and variable spelling is preserved.</p>
<p>Editors' punctuation style is preserved.</p>
<p style='margin-top: 1.5em;'><b>Transcriber Changes</b></p>
<p>The following changes were made to the original text:</p>
<p><a href='#TC_1'>Page 529</a>: Was 'If' (<b>It</b> is said that for some time past he would start nervously)</p>
<p><a href='#TC_2'>Page 542</a>: Added period (for she is very <b>high-minded.</b> Her weekly bath gives rise to)</p>
